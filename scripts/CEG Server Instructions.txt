CEG Server Instructions for Kelly Lab


Needs: 

    Bash terminal or other SSH program
    Cyberduck or other SFTP program


Notes:

    SSH is how you control the remote server
    SFTP is how you move files back and forth


Startup Steps (explained below):

	1. Generate a public/private key. Send me the public one. 

	2. Login to the CEG Server of your choice.

	3. Run a test blast search using a test fasta file that lives on the server.


Detailed Explanations:

	Key

		-  on a Mac, open a terminal and type: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ceg_rsa` then, look at the resulting key by typing `cat ~/.ssh/ceg_rsa.pub` and send me the resulting text at rpkelly@uw.edu. I will then enter it on the server.

		- on a Windows machine, at a command-prompt, type `ssh-keygen`, and save the file in the default location (something like `C:\Users\yourname/.ssh/id_rsa`
		
			**FROM GIT BASH**: 
			mfisher5@SEFS-9TR67P8 MINGW64 ~
			$ pwd
			>> /c/Users/mfisher5
			mfisher5@SEFS-9TR67P8 MINGW64 ~
			$ ssh-keygen
			>> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
			>> Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa): /c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa
			>> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
			>> Enter same passphrase again:
				Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa
				Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
				The key fingerprint is:...



		- navigate to the hidden “.ssh” directory in your home folder (or wherever you stored the key), open the file you created (`id_rsa.pub`) in a text editor, and send it to me.

		- store your key on your hard drive `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/ceg_rsa`
		
			**FROM GIT BASH**
			mfisher5@SEFS-9TR67P8 MINGW64 ~
			$ exec ssh-agent bash
			mfisher5@SEFS-9TR67P8 MINGW64 ~
			$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
			>> Enter passphrase for /c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa:
			>> Identity added: /c/Users/mfisher5/.ssh/id_rsa (mfisher5@SEFS-9TR67P8)


		-  I will then confirm that I’ve stored it on the server to give you access

	Login

		-  after the above steps, then:

    open a terminal window on your computer and type the following:   `ssh -p 3004 KellyCEG@frustule.ocean.washington.edu`  (without the quotes).  This says “open a secure shell connection, using port 3004, and connect to the server at frustule.ocean.washington.edu using username KellyCEG.  
    If all goes well, you should see a command-prompt pop up in the terminal.


Screen

	If you are running jobs on the server that will take a while, you can run `screen` after you login to the server, but before you start your job.  See https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/.  This lets you close your computer and still have your job be running (and also lets you have multiple windows open at once in the same ssh session, I think). 


File management

	- make a folder within KellyCEG with a three-letter set of initials (or similar); that will be your folder.

	- in the main KellyCEG folder will be a small number of things: blast executables and other files we all might need, for example. Let’s try to keep it clean.

	- Obviously, only move/delete files that you own


R

	if you want to launch R, just type `R` at the command line after logging into the server. Many packages are already installed.


Moving things off of and onto the server

	SFTP should recognize your key, and you won’t need a password to login to the server if all goes well. This is the easiest way to move things off of or onto the server.

	Cyberduck: In "Open Connection" (type: FTP-SSH)
		
		- server name is frustule.ocean.washington.edu
		
		- user name is KellyCEG
		
		- port is 3004
		
		- no password
		
		- select .ssh key *not from the dropdown list*, but using the "CHOOSE" option
